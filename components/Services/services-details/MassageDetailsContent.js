              <h3>Lymphatic Drainage Massage</h3>
              <p>
                Lymphatic drainage massage is a form of gentle massage that
                encourages the drainage of lymph nodes and the movement of lymph
                fluids around the body. It can help relieve symptoms of
                lymphedema.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lymphatic massage, sometimes called manual lymphatic drainage,
                is a specialized type of medical massage. It can help treat
                lymphedema, in which lymphatic fluid collects in certain areas
                of the body because it cannot drain away effectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lymphatic massage aims to improve the flow of lymph fluid, which
                should reduce swelling. Massaging an area without swelling will
                make space for fluid to flow to those parts from more congested
                areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two types of lymphatic drainage: Manual, performed by
                a qualified therapist, and Simple, a technique a person can use
                at home. It is essential to learn simple lymphatic drainage from
                a specialist.

                Cryolipolysis with Plate for Treatment of Localized Adiposity
              </h3>
              <p>
                Cryolipolysis is a non-invasive treatment, an alternative to
                liposuction or lipolaser, effective in eliminating unwanted fat
                without surgery. Visible improvements start 15 days after the
                session, with definitive results 6 weeks later.
              </p>
              <p>
                Suitable for both men and women, the treatment targets the
                abdomen, outer thighs, flanks, and back. A cold plate is applied
                over an antifreeze membrane on the treatment area, with minimal
                discomfort due to the sedative effect of the cold.

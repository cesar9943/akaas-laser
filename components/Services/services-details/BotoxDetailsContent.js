                Jeuveau is a botulinum toxin type A injection used in the
                treatment of wrinkles, also known as the new Botox or “Newtox”.
                It’s a newer version of the same active ingredient used in
                original Botox Cosmetic injections and is a better fit for
                certain types of facial wrinkles, often at a slightly cheaper
                price.
              </p>
              <p>
                When considering wrinkle treatments, including injectables, it’s
                important to weigh all factors. Both Botox and Jeuveau contain
                botulinum toxin type A, a neurotoxin that works by relaxing
                muscles beneath the skin to create a smoother appearance.

                During your consultation, you can discuss the benefits, risks,
                and costs of your treatment, and if needed, set up a payment
                plan. These treatments require no downtime, though you may
                choose to take a day off for your appointment.

                Dermal fillers are made from hyaluronic acid, a substance
                naturally produced in your skin. As we age, we lose facial
                volume, and dermal fillers can restore it. Commonly used in the
                lips and under the eyes, they provide a natural, immediate, and
                long-lasting result.

            <h2>Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Injections</h2>

                Platelet-rich plasma consists of plasma and platelets, which
                play a crucial role in healing. PRP injections, used for various
                conditions, involve creating a concentrated mixture of platelets
                by spinning a blood sample in a centrifuge.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process of PRP therapy enhances healing and tissue
                regeneration. PRP is researched for many uses, with orthopaedic
                injuries and wound healing being the most common applications.

            <h2>What is PRF Filler?</h2>
            <div className="article-services-image">

              <p>
                PRF, or Platelet-rich fibrin, is the next generation of PRP. It
                is created by spinning blood at a lower G force, preserving the
                cell scaffolding – fibrin, along with white blood cells and
                mesenchymal stem cells. This process results in a natural gel
                filler rich in growth factors, ideal for facial rejuvenation.
              </p>
              <p>
                PRF filler benefits include being all-natural, suitable for
                almost every patient, minimal side effects, and lasting results
                for up to one year. It’s particularly effective for under-eye
                treatment, skin laxity, and texture improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                PRF delivers more growth factors than PRP and uses a completely
                natural and unmodified extraction process. The result is a more
                efficient treatment with better blood flow and diffusion,
                leading to overall tissue rejuvenation, reduced scars, improved
                skin tone, and new collagen production.

              <h3>Your Treatment Experience</h3>
              <p>
                When you come to our Medical Spa for PRF filler treatment, we
                will use a sample of your blood to create the PRF filler. The
                blood sample is processed in a slow-moving centrifuge,
                separating out the growth factors, leukocytes, and stem cells.
                This filler is then injected into multiple facial areas for
                volume and rejuvenation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recovery is minimal with no downtime required. The first results
                will be apparent in about three months, with full effects
                visible at 6-12 months, revealing brighter, healthier, and
                smoother skin.

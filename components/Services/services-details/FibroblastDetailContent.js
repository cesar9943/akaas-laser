              <h2>What is Fibroblast Plasma Skin Tightening?</h2>
              <p>
                As we age, the dermal layer of our skin thins, our bodies
                produce less collagen, and we lose elasticity, leading to
                wrinkles and sagging skin. Our certified plasma pen technicians
                use the fibroblast plasma treatment to eliminate signs of aging
                by tightening and lifting sagging skin.
              </p>

              <h2>How is this done?</h2>
              <p>
                Micro charges of plasma energy are applied to the skin in a
                non-contact way via a wand, causing sublimation of the tissue at
                very superficial levels, which eliminates excess tissue and
                reduces or even eliminates wrinkles and saggy tissue.
              </p>

              <h2>What does sublimation of the skin mean?</h2>
              <p>
                Sublimation occurs when a solid turns into a gas without
                becoming a liquid first. The plasma pen device targets a micro
                beam of plasma energy onto the skin, causing skin retraction and
                tightening in the treated area only, promoting immediate
                tightening and, through the healing process, increased collagen
                production.
              </p>

              <h2>Does it hurt?</h2>
              <p>
                A topical anesthetic is applied to minimize discomfort, although
                a slight burning sensation may be felt during treatment. The
                anesthetic helps to make the procedure tolerable.
              </p>

              <h2>What areas of the body can be treated?</h2>
              <ul className="list">
                <li>
                  Upper and lower eyelid sagging, bags, and lines (non-surgical

                  Lines around the mouth, neck tightening, and smokers lines

              <h2>Aftercare and Downtime</h2>
              <p>
                Post-treatment, expect some redness and swelling, with tiny dark
                brown spots where the micro dots were placed. These spots should
                fall off naturally, protecting the skin underneath. After about
                5-7 days, these spots fall off, possibly leaving slight redness.
                Mineral makeup can be worn 24-48 hours after treatment, and sun
                protection must be applied to protect the healing skin.

              <h2>Results</h2>
              <p>
                Some skin tightening will be visible immediately after
                treatment, with optimal results appearing 6-8 weeks later.
                Results can last 9-18 months, depending on lifestyle factors.
                Multiple treatments, spaced at least 6 weeks apart, may be
                necessary for optimum results.

              <h2>Who is a candidate for fibroblast plasma treatments?</h2>
              <p>
                Ideal candidates are those with a low Fitzpatrick level (I-III).
                People with darker skin tones or certain skin conditions may not
                be suitable candidates. A free consultation is offered to assess
                skin and discuss treatment expectations.

              <p>
                Preparation includes avoiding sun exposure and stopping use of
                retinoids and acids 1 week prior. Men should shave facial hair
                in treatment areas on the day of the appointment. The skin
                should be clean without any lotions, oils, or makeup.

              <h2>What to Expect During the Fibroblast Procedure</h2>
              <p>
                The procedure involves cleansing and numbing the treatment area,
                followed by the application of plasma energy via a pen. The
                treatment takes about 30-60 minutes, with immediate
                post-treatment effects including tiny brown dots and possible
                swelling. Recovery involves simple aftercare, with most patients
                resuming normal activities quickly.

                Believe it or not, your eyebrows are a massive part of your
                look. They can help shape and define your face and can be coaxed
                and molded in a hundred different ways. One of the most recently
                popular is eyebrow threading.

              <p>
                Eyebrow threading uses a thin piece of thread to remove eyebrow
                hair. It’s a simple process that requires practice to perfect
                but has quick, controlled results. Before you get your eyebrows
                threaded, there are a few things to take into consideration.
                However, the process isn’t any worse than waxing or plucking.

              <h2>What Is Eyebrow Threading?</h2>
              <p>
                Eyebrow threading is the process of removing eyebrow hair using
                a piece of thread. The thread is typically made of cotton and is
                relatively thin to allow a stronger hold on each strand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eyebrow threading was practiced in multiple different cultures
                for several thousand years. While no one knows where it actually
                originated, the popular theory is that it started in either
                India or Iran, where a woman would carefully thread her eyebrows
                for cosmetic and cultural reasons. It was also popular in China,
                where thin brows were a mark of sophistication.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, threading has been adopted by cultures worldwide and is
                one of the most popular methods of unwanted hair removal.

              <h2>How Does Eyebrow Threading Work?</h2>
              <p>
                Eyebrow threading is a form of epilation. The process removes
                the entire hair, including the root, rather than cutting it. It
                starts with cleaning the skin under and around the eyebrows with
                a gentle cleanser or quick wipe with alcohol to make sure the
                area is sterile, and it is easy to see the hairs.
              </p>
              <p>
                A technician will hold a piece of thread between their hands,
                occasionally with one end in their teeth, and twist it. They’ll
                then hold the end of the twist over the section of hair you want
                removed and move the thread in a swift motion. The twisting
                motion traps hairs between the threads and lifts them out whole.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process is relatively quick, taking only about ten minutes
                with an experienced technician.

              <h2>Can You Thread Other Body Hair?</h2>
              <p>
                Threading is an excellent process for your eyebrows and
                occasionally for upper lip hair, but generally, it’s for facial
                hair only. Threading is an incredibly precise treatment meant
                for shaping rather than full removal, so it wouldn’t be an
                efficient way of removing larger swaths of hair from the arms,
                legs, or other parts of the body.

              <h2>The Pros and Cons of Eyebrow Threading</h2>
              <p>
                As with every hair removal treatment, there are both benefits
                and drawbacks to eyebrow threading to consider. The individual
                lists will vary from person to person, but generally, here are
                the pros and cons of eyebrow threading.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Pros of Eyebrow Threading: Of course, the speed of the
                process is a major benefit. It’s less painful than many people
                expect, especially when compared to waxing or tweezing.
                Maintaining threaded eyebrows is relatively easy, as you only
                need to go to professional appointments every 4-6 weeks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Cons of Eyebrow Threading: Depending on the salon you
                choose, your threading appointments may cost anywhere from $5 to
                more than $30. Also, as with any epilation process, there will
                be some irritation around the area for hours afterward. You’ll
                also have to be very careful about the aesthetician you choose.

              <h2>Is Eyebrow Threading Worth It?</h2>
              <p>
                Maintaining your eyebrows is a personal choice, but for some,
                eyebrow threading is definitely worth the cost. It’s an
                excellent choice for people who want to keep their look precise
                and clean but can’t afford to spend hours plucking or perfecting
                on their own.

              <h2>Tips for First Time Eyebrow Threading</h2>
              <p>
                If you decide that threading is for you, here are a few things
                to remember for your first appointment. Do your research. Don’t
                schedule your threading appointment immediately before a big
                event. Take a pain reliever before your appointment. Don’t wear
                makeup. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Aloe is your friend.

              <p>
                The next time your brows are looking a little rough, consider
                getting them threaded. As long as you go into it knowing what’s
                going to happen and what to look for, eyebrow threading can be
                an efficient and effective way to shape and form your brows to

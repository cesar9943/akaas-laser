                <h3>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
                <p>
                  We use the Purchase Information that we collect generally to
                  fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including
                  processing your payment information, arranging for shipping,
                  and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations).
                  Additionally, we use this Purchase Information to:

                <p>
                  We use the Browsing Information that we collect to help us
                  screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP
                  address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site
                  (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers
                  browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success
                  of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
